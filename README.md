# GitBurger 

GitBurger is a group project developed as part of our Software Engineering studies.  
The project simulates a simple restaurant ordering system where orders are placed and handled through different views.

This was our first programming project, and the main focus was to learn how a web application is structured, how different parts communicate and how to work together in a development team.

---

## Project Overview

The system is divided into multiple parts:
- **Order view** – used to place orders
- **Kitchen view** – used to handle and manage incoming orders
- **Server & views** – handles routing, logic, and rendering
- **Database** – simple SQL-based setup
- **Docker** – used to containerize and run the application

The project demonstrates a basic full-stack structure and separation of responsibilities between different components.

##  What we Learned

- How a web application is structured from backend to views
- How to break down a larger problem into smaller components
- Basics of working with databases in a web project
- Using Docker to run multi-service applications
- Collaborating in a team using Git

##  Running the Project

The application is designed to be run using **Docker Compose**.

Requirements:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Start the application from the project root:
```bash
